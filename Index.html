    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[Adopt a cybersecurity framework. Train your staff and keep them up to date with the system and all the changes. Add HHTPS and SSL certificate. Use anti-malware software and plugins and keep them up to date. Choose a strong password. Use a secure web-host that offers SFTP. Backup your website regularly. Change your CMS default settings because the most common attacks against websites are entirely automated and what many attack bots rely on is for users to have their CMS settings on default. Implement an automatic user timeout. Know your web server configuration files. Make sure you apply for a web application firewall. Add a two-factor authenticator. Record User Access and Administrative Privileges]</p>
